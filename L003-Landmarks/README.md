# Landmarks

## 1. SwiftUI Essentials

### 1.1 Creating and Combining Views

#### Section 1 : Create a New Project and Explore the Canvas

Create a new Xcode project that uses SwiftUI. Explore the canvas, previews, and the SwiftUI template code.

To preview and interact with views from the canvas in Xcode, ensure your Mac is running macOS Catalina 10.15.

#### Section 2 : Customize the Text View

You can customize a view’s display by changing your code, or by using the inspector to discover what’s available and to help you write code.

As you build the Landmarks app, you can use any combination of editors: the source editor, the canvas, or the inspectors. Your code stays updated, regardless of which tool you use.

#### Section 3 : Combine Views Using Stacks

Beyond the title view you created in the previous section, you’ll add text views to contain details about the landmark, such as the name of the park and state it’s in.

When creating a SwiftUI view, you describe its content, layout, and behavior in the view’s body property; however, the body property only returns a single view. You can combine and embed multiple views in stacks, which group views together horizontally, vertically, or back-to-front.

In this section, you’ll use a vertical stack to place the title above a horizontal stack that contains details about the park.

#### Section 4 : Create a Custom Image View

With the name and location views all set, the next step is to add an image for the landmark.

Instead of adding more code in this file, you’ll create a custom view that applies a mask, border, and drop shadow to the image.

#### Section 5 : Use UIKit and SwiftUI Views Together
